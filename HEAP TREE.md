# Experiment 9(d): Heap Tree

## Aim
To write a Python program to build a heap tree using appropriate Python package and function.

---

## Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Import the `heapq` module.
3. Define a function `heaptree()` that takes a list `H` as input.
4. Use `heapq.heapify(H)` to convert the list into a valid heap (min-heap).
5. Print the created heap.
6. End the program.

## Program

```
REG NO- 212223060120
NAME- KAVIYA PRIYA K
import heapq
def heaptree(H):
    heapq.heapify(H)
    print("The created Heap is",H)

```

## RESULT
Thus the Python program to build a heap tree using appropriate Python package and function was written and executed successfully.
